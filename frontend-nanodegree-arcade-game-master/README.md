## Project Name 

The Arcade Game
 
## Description
My Arcade Game contains a player and enemies(bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into  one of the enemies. the player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. once at the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset amd player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game us won.

## Issue
there is a little issue with bugs speed, I will fix that.

## Future Planning
* I want to add back ground animation to my game, so that it looks more attractive.
* I want to set time out property, so that users will have limited time to finish this game.
* I want to implement star counter on it, that will show the number of stars earned by my player.
