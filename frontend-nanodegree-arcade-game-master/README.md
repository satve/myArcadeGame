## Project Name 

The Arcade Game
 
## Description
My Arcade Game contains a player and enemies(bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into  one of the enemies. the player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. once at the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset amd player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game us won.

## How To Play
1. The game board consists of sixteen cards. It is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each card has a symbol.
2. Users need to click card to reveal its symbol side. Then you click on another card.
3. After flipping cards if two cards have same symbol, then they remained open and their color changes to green. 
4. After every two clicks , the moves button counts the moves.
5. If two cards are not same, they will automatically flip again and hide its symbol. 
6. Users need to select cards again and again until all card matched.
7. When all cards are matched, you can see pop up alert at the top, that means you won the match.
8. At the end if you want to restart the game, you can press reset button, that is located on the upper right side of grid.

## Issue
The reset button doesnot work properly. In future, I will fix that.

## Future Planning
* I want to add back ground animation to my game, so that it looks more attractive.
* I want to set time out property, so that users will have limited time to finish this game.
